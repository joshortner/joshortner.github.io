Hey! My name is Josh Ortner. This is my website. Here, I write about about the topics in Computer Science that I'm most curious about. That tends Remote Sensing and Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, and Web Technologies.

I have an Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, and a year of experience conducting AI/Data Science research with two national labs: [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/) and [Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov/). Check out my [resume](https://joshortner.github.io/resume) if you're interested in learning more about my experience.
