Hello, my name is Josh! I'm an Embedded Software Engineer specializing in the development of space-based scientific sensors. 

My coding interests outside of work are centered around computer graphics and game development. All of my projects and tech demos use a custom graphics/game dev framework called [Stella](https://gitlab.com/jortner0210/stella-game-engine). My resume is [here](https://joshortner.github.io/resume), my email is jlortner@gmail.com, and some of my projects are below.
