# What is MongoDB

- Documents: JSON data 
    - JSON fields can vary document to document
    - Data can be pretty much anything: strings, numbers, arrays, nested objects
    - Internally JSON is stored as binary: BSON

- Collections: a group of documents
    - Like a table in relational dbs
    - Don't enforce a schema, fields can vary doc to doc



# Why MongoDB?

- Simple
- Highly adaptable, not tied to DB scheme like relational dbs
