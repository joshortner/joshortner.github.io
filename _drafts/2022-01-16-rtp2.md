# 1. Introduction

I'll keep this intro short and sweet. This post picks up where the [first](https://joshortner.github.io/raytracing-part-one) raytracing post left off. I'll be starting at section 7, Antialiasing, in [RTIOW](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#antialiasing).

# 2. Aliasing

I first learned about aliasing pretty early on in my graphics journey. I'd imagine it's the same for most people, as "jaggies" are visible the moment you draw anything that isn't a straight line. I learned that it's a side effect of using pixels to generate images, and it could mostly be handled with some OpenGL setting (TO DO: Look into this, I don't remember how I solved it before, blend?). When I got to the anti aliasing section in RTIOW, I realized I hadn't given much thought to the details of the phenomenon. So, I started doing more research and fell into a mildly deep rabbit hole and gain some really valuable insight into how to think about computer graphics in a fundamental way, and a better understanding of signal processing which, as an aspiring Computer Scientist, is something I should be spending more time on. 

There is a really great blog post describing in detail, why aliasing occurs in computer graphics. Check it out [here](https://apoorvaj.io/aliasing-in-computer-graphics/). I'm definitely not going to try and rehash the details here. Instead, I'll explain some of the intuition I gained from reading it.

The first thing I learned is that Aliasing is related to the larger field of signal processing. 

Raytracing can be thought of as sampling a continuous space at descrete intervals. The samples are taken at pixel centers, so the sampling period is the distance between pixel centers{{ page.aliasingpost }}, which is just the size of the pixel.

A pixel is not a square, it is a point sample: [A pixel is not a little square](http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf).

"An image is a rectilinear array of point samples (pixels). The marvelous Sampling Theorem tells us that we can reconstruct a continuous entity from such a discrete entity using an appropriate reconstruction filter 3"

Types of reconstruction filters:
