# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

This is the first blog in a series where I'll document my progress developing a private, web-based messaging application. There are two primary goals for this project:

1. Gain a deeper understanding of some web technologies:
- Golang
- ReactJS
- NoSQL
- Websockets
- The networking stack in general

2. Develop an open-source, decentralized communication application.

The first goal is the main focus for now. The second is the larger vision for the project. I always like to have an ambitious goal for any project I start to act as a guiding light.

The general idea of the application is to allow for users-managed servers. So some users will host servers on a personal machine, while others can use the frontend to connect to a known server, create an account and, once authorized, hold conversations with other users registered on the server. It's similar to how some online video games work: Minecraft and Valheim are good examples.

Why user-managed servers? Because data is power and I think it's pretty cool to empower non-technical internet users to take ownership of their data and privacy. This is a small first step in that direction.  

## 1.2 The Minimum Viable Product

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/architecture.jpeg" alt="drawing" height="250" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

The unique aspect of this application is the user-hosted servers. Ideally anyone, regardless of technical ability, will be able to download the server code and run an instance on their own machine. The client is a simple web-based interface that can connect to and interact with a server.

Here are the functional requirements for the MVP:
1. Create an account
2. Login to an existing account
3. Manage conversations with other users
4. Send and recieve messages in real time
5. Manage user access

The client MVP will need to enable all of the above functionality, while also being intuitive and pretty.

Each of these posts will describe the implementation of a small set of features. For now I'll include as many details as possible. As the application grows in complexity though I may have to switch to summarizing. We'll see...

In this post I'll talk about the following features:
1. Server initialization and startup
2. Logging
3. Command Line Interface
4. The first HTTP endpoint: User Registration

## 1.3 Disclaimer...

A couple things I'd like to note before moving forward:
1. The client: I'm not going to work on a nice looking frontend until the server MVP is finished. Any client code I write for now will be for testing the functionality of the server. It'll be vanilla JavaScript and not pretty.
2. Concurrency: Go has really nice features for writing concurrent code, and concurrency will be absolutely necessary for this application to scale with users. While I'm keeping this in mind, I probably won't implement hardcore concurrency until I have a better idea of how all the pieces of the system are going to fit together. Once I have an MVP I'll run experiments to find the best use of concurrency.
3. I'm developing and testing everything locally. Opening up a local network to the big bad internet is a whole process with it's own set of complications. I'll address this and it's security implications when I'm further along. 
4. Errors and Constants: To keep the code concise, I won't be showing the declaration of constants or error checking. Constants are denoted by all caps, snake case variables. It shouldn't matter what their actual value is as long as their purpose is clear.

## 1.4 Why Go?

The website says it best:[^fn17]
- It's open source and supported by Google
- It's easy to learn
- It has built-in concurrenty and a robust standard library
- A growing ecosystem

Talking points like this can sometimes just be meaningless fluff. The reason I included them though is because they feel true with Go. The best way I know to explain the language is that it's no nonsense. It's extremely simple in the best way. It's like C for the modern age.

I'll refrain from fanboying further. Here are specific reasons I decided to use it for this project:
1. Concurrency: It's concurrency api is really hard to beat.  
2. Static typed and compiled. The binary contains the entire runtime and there are no interpreters to deal with, which is always preferred in my mind. It *is* garbage collected, which I was suprised to learn. But I was also suprised to learn about the work that's gone into overcoming traditional GC performance issues. The details could fill an entire post. Check out [this](https://go.dev/blog/ismmkeynote) talk if you want to learn more.
3. Networking libraries. Writing networking code is just so frictionless with the exisiting libraries.

# 2. Feature Implementations

## 2.1 The Server

We'll start dead simple. An empty struct to represent the Server:

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

type Server struct {

}

func NewServer() Server {
    return Server{}
}

{% endhighlight %}

And the entry point:

{% highlight golang %}

// File: main.go

func main() {
    cxt := NewServer()
}

{% endhighlight %}

The server struct will be filled gradually with the systems/objects required to run a server. 

## 2.2 Server initialization and Startup

There are two potential launch states for the server.

1. Initialization - the first launch
2. Startup - Any subsequent launch

### 2.2.1 Initialization

The server needs a directory to store persistant data. In the first extension of NewServer, I'll check for the existence of a given directory and execute initialization code if necessary. 

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

func NewServer(serverDir string) Server {
    exists, err := utils.PathExists(serverDir)

    if !exists {
        initializeServer()
    }
    ...
}

// File: main.go

func main() {
    cxt := NewServer("./srv")
}

{% endhighlight %}

The utils.PathExists comes from a local package that will hold general helper functions. PathExists wraps a couple other functions from Go's os package: os.Stat[^fn5] and os.IsNotExists.[^fn6] os.Stat returns a FileInfo[^fn7] struct describing the named file, while os.IsNotExist checks if the error returned by os.Stat indicates that the file or directory does not exist.

{% highlight golang %}

// File: utils/file.go

func PathExists(path string) (bool, error) {
    _, err := os.Stat(path)
    if err == nil { return true, nil }
    if os.IsNotExist(err) { return false, nil }
    return false, err
}

{% endhighlight %}

Before implementing initializeServer, I'll add a new struct to hold all of the server directories and file paths. It's called ServerDiskContext. The only directories I need right now are base and log. I'll use the Join function from Go's filepath library to generate subdirectories,[^fn8] and the updated code looks like this:

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

type ServerDiskContext struct {
    BaseDir string
    LogDir string
}

func NewServer(serverDir string) Server {
    ...
    diskCxt := ServerDiskContext{
        BaseDir: serverDir, 
        LogDir: filepath.Join(serverDir, LOG_DIRECTORY),
    }

    if !exists {
        initializeServer(diskCxt)
    }
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now I'll implement initializeServer. For now the job of this function is simply to create the directories specified in the ServerDiskContext struct.[^fn9]

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

func initializeServer(diskContext ServerDiskContext) {
    err := os.Mkdir(diskContext.BaseDir, 0755)
    ...
    err = os.Mkdir(diskContext.LogDir, 0755)
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

Building and running the code so far produces a directory like this:

```bash
C:.
│   <server>.exe
│
└───srv
    └───log
```

### 2.2.2 Startup

Now I want a function where I can put code to load and generate resources. There isn't anything happening here yet, but I'm including it now so it can be extended later.

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

type Server struct {
    DiskContext ServerDiskContext
}

func NewServer(serverDir string) *Server {
    ...
    server := startupServer(diskCxt)
    return server
}

func startupServer(diskContext ServerDiskContext) *Server {
    return &Server{
        DiskContext: diskContext,
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

## 2.3 Logging

I'd like a way to track the actions of the server without muddying up the terminal with print statements. There's a nice logging package available for Go that I'll use for now.[^fn2] It has various print functions built in and functionality to pipe the output to a specified file. This is all I need to get started. I'll add a server method to generate a new log file and then log the end of the NewServer function.

{% highlight golang %}

func NewServer(serverDir string) *Server {
    ...
    log.Println("Server startup completed!")
    return server
}

func startupServer(diskContext ServerDiskContext) *Server {
    server := Server{
        DiskContext: diskContext,
    }

    server.GenerateNewLogFile()
    return &server
}

{% endhighlight %}

For now the server will generate a new log file every time it starts up. It will log to that file until it's shut down. I'll probably have to revist this and come up with a different scheme as the complexity of logging increases. 

Now, to implement GenerateNewLogFile. Log files will be named by converting a time stamp from Go's time package[^fn3] to a string and appending ".log". This is probably something else I'll need to revisit. Right now though I'm keeping things simple until the basic functionality is proven.

{% highlight golang %}

func (s *Server) GenerateNewLogFile() {
	newLogPath := filepath.Join(s.DiskContext.LogDir, 
                                    time.Now().Format("2006-01-02_15_04_05") + ".log")
}

{% endhighlight %}

Next, I'll create the log file and and set the output of the log package. The code below should be self-explanatory, but you can check out the links for more info: os.OpenFile,[^fn10] log.SetFlags,[^fn11] and log.SetOutput.[^fn12]

{% highlight golang %}

func (s *Server) GenerateNewLogFile() {
    ...
    logFile, err := os.OpenFile(newLogPath, 
                                os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREATE | os.O_APPEND, 
                                0666) 

    log.SetFlags(log.Lshortfile | log.LstdFlags)
    log.SetOutput(logFile)
}

{% endhighlight %}

After building and running, the server directory looks like this:

```bash
C:.
│   <server>.exe
│
└───srv
    └───log
            log_2022-01-11_18:58:19     
```

And the contents of the log file are:

```bash
2022/01/11 18:58:19 server.go:37: Server startup completed!
```

## 2.4 Command Line Interface

A command line interface will be necessary to enable user interaction with the server during runtime. Additionaly, for development/debugging purposes, it will be nice to have some hooks into the internals of the server.

The CLI simply reads input from the terminal, checks if the input matches an internal command, and then runs the callback associated with that command. A few default commands will be hard coded into the CLI itself, but the rest of the functionality will be defined by the user of the package.

I'll make a new package called cli, and use Go's bufio[^fn4] package to read input from the terminal.

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: cli/cli.go

type CLI struct {	
    Reader *bufio.Reader
}

func NewCLI() CLI {
    return CLI{
        Reader: bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin),
    }
}

func (cli *CLI) Run() {
	
    fmt.Println("|------------------------------------|")
    fmt.Println("|----- SERVER CLI Version 0.0.0 -----|")
    fmt.Println("|------------------------------------|")

    for {
        fmt.Print("server> ")

        cmd, err := cli.Reader.ReadString('\n')

        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error! -", err)
        }

        cmd = strings.TrimSpace(cmd)

        fmt.Println(cmd)
    }

}

// File: main.go

func main() {
    ...
    cmdli := cli.NewCLI()
    cmdli.Run()
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

The call to bufio.NewReader[^fn13] returns a new bufio.Reader. This is an object that implements the io.Reader interface[^fn18] to allow for buffered reading. Buffered reading reduces the number of system calls by reading a predefined number of bytes at a time into a memory buffer. I'm using the default size, which is defined in the source code to be 4096 bytes.[^fn19]

Side note: The reason buffered reading and writing is important is because both operations are system calls. System calls are special functions that may lead to a [context switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch). A context switches and mode switches are particularly expensive operations. Because of that, it's important to be able to recognize when a function is a system call so it's execution can be limited.

In addition to the bufio package, I'm also using the strings[^fn15] package to clean up the user input.

The above code produces the following output:

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/cli.png" alt="drawing" height="200" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

More creative visuals for this is a problem for future me.

Now I need a way to add commands. To implement this I'll use a hash map to store command names (string) and their associated data. The data will be in the form of a new struct called CommandInfo that contains the command name, an info string, and a callback function.

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: cli/cli.go

type CLI struct {	
    ...
    CommandMap map[string]CommandInfo
}

type CommandInfo struct {
    Name string 
    Info string
    Callback func()
}

func (cli *CLI) RegisterCommand(cmdInfo CommandInfo) {
    _, ok := cli.CommandMap[cmdInfo.Name]

    if ok {
        log.Println("Command already registered", cmdInfo.Name)
    } else {
        log.Println("Command successfully registered:", cmdInfo.Name)
        cli.CommandMap[cmdInfo.Name] = cmdInfo
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

RegisterCommand just ensures there isn't a naming conflict and then adds the command to it's CommandMap.

Next, I'll update NewCLI to add a default "help" command and implement its callback function:

{% highlight golang %}

func NewCLI() CLI {
    cli := CLI{
        Reader: bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin),
        CommandMap: make(map[string]CommandInfo),
    }

    cli.RegisterCommand(CommandInfo{
        Name: "help",
        Info: "This command will help you out",
        Callback: cli.helpCommandCallback,
    })

    return cli
}

func (cli *CLI) helpCommandCallback() {
    if len(cli.CommandMap) == 0 {
        fmt.Println("No commands available")	
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Available Commands:")
        for key, cmdInfo := range cli.CommandMap {
            fmt.Printf("\t- %s: %s\n", key, cmdInfo.Info)
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

I'll also edit the CLI's Run function to handle commands received from input.

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: cli/cli.go

func (cli *CLI) Run() {
    ...
    for {
        ...
        cli.handleCommand(cmd)
    }
}

func (cli *CLI) handleCommand(cmd string) {
    cmdInfo, ok := cli.CommandMap[cmd]
    if ok {
        cmdInfo.Callback()
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Unknown Command:", cmd)
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Running the "help" command produces: 

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/help-command.png" alt="drawing" height="150" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

## 2.5  User Registration

The last thing I want to touch on in this post is creating the first HTTP endpoint: User Registration.

First, a breathtaking frontend:

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/registration.png" alt="drawing" height="115px" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

And its code:

{% highlight html %}

// FILE: frontend/index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Communication Application Backend Functionality</title>
	<script src="index.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

	<!-- User Registration -->
	<button onclick="onClickRegister()">Register</button>
	<label for="register-uname">Username:</label>
	<input type="text" id="register-uname" name="register-uname">

	<label for="register-password">Password:</label>
	<input type="text" id="register-password" name="register-password">

  </body>
</html> 

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

// FILE: frontend/index.js

const onClickRegister = async () => {
    var username = document.getElementById("register-uname").value
    var password = document.getElementById("register-password").value

    if (username != "" && password != "") 
    {
        const res = await registerUser(username, password)
        if (res.ok)
        {
            console.log("User Successfully Registered:", username, password)
        }
        else
        {
            const errorText = await res.text();
            console.log("Error:", res.status, errorText)
        }
    }
    else
    {
        console.log("Enter a username and password")
    }
}


const registerUser = async (username, password) => {
    const res = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/register", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Accept": "application/json", "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ "username": username, "password": password })
    })

    return res
}

{% endhighlight %}

The above code hits the /register endpoint with a username and password. I'm including it here for the sake of completeness, but I'm not going to talk about it. I'll discuss frontend code when I start developing the frontend. 

I'm using Go's net/http package to handle http functionality.[^fn20] Running a simple server requires only two function calls: http.ListenAndServe and http.HandleFunc. 

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: main.go

func main() {
    ...
    go cmdli.Run()

    http.HandleFunc("/register", server.RegisterHandler)

    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil))
}

{% endhighlight %}

The function http.ListenAndServe starts an HTTP server on a given port with a given http.Handler. I'm passing nil in place of a handler which means use the DefaultServeMux (mux stands for multiplexer). The job of the handler is simply to execute the appropriate handler for a given request. The http.HandleFunc function adds a handler for a given endpoint to the DefaultServeMux.

Also, you'll notice I added the "go" keyword to the line calling the cli's Run method. This is Go's keyword to create a goroutine, which is Go's version of a thread.[^fn21] The Run and ListenAndServe functions run forever so they both need their own thread of execution. I'll put Run on a goroutine and keep ListenAndServe on the main thread.

Now I need to implement server.RegisterHandler. The function signature required by HandleFunc looks like this:

{% highlight golang %}

func RegisterHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

The ResponseWriter is an interface that's used by an HTTP handler to construct an HTTP response.[^fn22] Request represents an HTTP request received by the server.[^fn23]

Here's the actual implementation of the handler:

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: server/endpoints.go

type RegisterEndpointData struct {
    Username string `json:"username"`
    Password string `json:"password"`
}

func RegisterHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if r.URL.Path != "/register" {
        http.Error(w, "404 not found.", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }

    if r.Method != "POST" {
        http.Error(w, "Method is not supported.", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }

    var reg RegisterEndpointData

    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&reg)
    if err != nil {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
        log.Println("Error:", err)
    }
}


{% endhighlight %}

First I do a couple checks for good measure: I check that the request URL matches the path expected by this handler, and then I check that the method type is a POST. If either of these checks fail I respond with an appropriate error. Next, I fill a struct with the data sent by the request and also respond with an error if the data isn't what's expected. Right now, the only thing this function really does and process decode the data recieved and send an appropriate response. There is no actual work being done to satisfy the request. In the name of Separation of Concerns, I want to do the work in a separate function. 

To do this, I'll extend the handler to accept a callback function. The callback function should take one argument, RegisterEndpointData, and return a boolean value denoting whether the request succeeded for failed.

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: server/endpoints.go

func RegisterHandler(callback func(RegisterEndpointData) bool, 
                     w http.ResponseWriter, 
                     r *http.Request) {
    ...

    ok := callback(reg)

    if !ok {
        http.Error(w, "Unable to register user", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    }
}


{% endhighlight %}

Now I need to update the http.HandleFunc call in main:

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: main.go

func main() {
    ...
    http.HandleFunc("/register", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		server.RegisterHandler(cxt.RegisterUser, w, r)
	})
}

{% endhighlight %}

And last but not least, I'll implement a temporary version of the new server method RegisterHandler:

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: server/server.go

var registeredUsers  = map[string]string{
    "admin": "password",
}

func (sc *Server) RegisterUser(data RegisterEndpointData) bool {
    for key, _ := range registeredUsers {
        if key == data.Username {
            log.Println("User registration failed. User already exists:", key)
            return false
        }
    }

    registeredUsers[data.Username] = data.Password
    log.Println("User registration success:", data.Username)

    return true
}

{% endhighlight %}

The "database" right now is just an in memory map of usernames and passwords. The RegisterUser method adds a new username and password to the map if it doesn't already exist.

I'm using the python server module[^fn24] to serve up the front end. It's great for development since it's as simple as running the following command in the directory you want to serve:

```bash
python -m http.server <port>
```

To do a little test, I launch the server, run the python script to serve the frontend, and then send the following two requests from the frontend:

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/admin-login.png" alt="drawing" height="45px" style="margin: 0 auto"/>
<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/newuser-login.png" alt="drawing" height="40.5px" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

And the output of the log file is:

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/final-log.png" alt="drawing" height="75px" style="margin: 0 auto"/>


# 3. Final Words

There you have it, a fully functional and robust messaging application...

Just kidding, of course. There's is a ton lacking here still, but at least nothing is catching on fire.

The very next thing I plan to do is implement an actual database. But that's for another post.f
