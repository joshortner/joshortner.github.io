# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

This is the first blog in a series where I'll document my progress developing a private, web-based messaging application. There are two primary goals for this project:

1. Gain a deeper understanding of some web technologies:
- Golang
- ReactJS
- NoSQL
- Websockets
- The networking stack in general

2. Develop an open-source, decentralized communication application.

The first goal is the main focus for now. The second is the larger vision for the project. I always like to have an ambitious goal for any project I start to act as a guiding light.

The general idea of the application is to allow for users-managed servers. So some users will host servers on a personal machine, while others can use the frontend to connect to a known server, create an account and, once authorized, hold conversations with other users registered on the server. It's similar to how some online video games work: Minecraft and Valheim are good examples.

Why user-managed servers? Because data is power and I think it's pretty cool to empower non-technical internet users to take ownership of their data and privacy. This is a small first step in that direction.  

## 1.2 The Minimum Viable Product

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/architecture.jpeg" alt="drawing" height="250" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

The unique aspect of this application is the user-hosted servers. Ideally anyone, regardless of technical ability, will be able to download the server code and run an instance on their own machine. The client is a simple web-based interface that can connect to and interact with a server. The focus of development for now will be on the server. 

Here are the functional requirements for the MVP:
1. Create an account
2. Login to an existing account
3. Manage conversations with other users
4. Send and recieve messages in real time
5. Manage user access

The client MVP will need to enable all of the above functionality, while also being intuitive and pretty.

Each of these posts will describe the implementation of a small set of features. For now I'll include as many details as possible. As the application grows in complexity though I may have to switch to summarizing. We'll see...

In this post I'll talk about the following features:
1. Server initialization and startup
2. Logging
3. Command Line Interface
4. The first HTTP endpoint: User Registration

## 1.3 Disclaimer...

A couple things I'd like to note before moving forward:
1. The client: I'm not going to work on a nice looking frontend until the server MVP is finished. Any client code I write for now will be for testing the functionality of the server. It'll be vanilla JavaScript and not pretty.
2. Concurrency: Go has really nice features for writing concurrent code, and concurrency will be absolutely necessary for this application to scale with users. While I'm keeping this in mind, I probably won't implement hardcore concurrency until I have a better idea of how all the pieces of the system are going to fit together. Once I have an MVP I'll run experiments to find the best use of concurrency.
3. I'm developing and testing everything locally. Opening up a local network to the big bad internet is a whole process with it's own set of complications. I'll address this and it's security implications when I'm further along. 
4. Errors and Constants: To keep the code concise, I won't be showing the declaration of constants or error checking. Constants are denoted by all caps, snake case variables. It shouldn't matter what their actual value is as long as their purpose is clear.

## 1.4 Why Go?

The website says it best:[^fn17]
- It's open source and supported by Google
- It's easy to learn
- It has built-in concurrenty and a robust standard library
- A growing ecosystem

Talking points like this can sometimes just be meaningless fluff. The reason I included them though is because they feel true with Go. The best way I know to explain the language is that it's no nonsense. It's extremely simple in the best way. It's like C for the modern age.

I'll refrain from fanboying further. Here are specific reasons I decided to use it for this project:
1. Concurrency: It's concurrency api is really hard to beat.  
2. Static typed and compiled. The binary contains the entire runtime and there are no interpreters to deal with, which is always preferred in my mind. It *is* garbage collected, which I was suprised to learn. But I was also suprised to learn about the work that's gone into overcoming traditional GC performance issues. The details could fill an entire post. Check out [this](https://go.dev/blog/ismmkeynote) talk if you want to learn more.
3. Networking libraries. Writing networking code is just so frictionless with the exisiting libraries.

# 2. Feature Implementations

## 2.1 The Server

We'll start dead simple. An empty struct to represent the Server:

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

type Server struct {

}

func NewServer() Server {
    return Server{}
}

{% endhighlight %}

And the entry point:

{% highlight golang %}

// File: main.go

func main() {
    cxt := NewServer()
}

{% endhighlight %}

The server struct will be filled gradually with the systems/objects required to run a server. 

## 2.2 Server initialization and Startup

There are two potential launch states for the server.

1. Initialization - the first launch
2. Startup - Any subsequent launch

### 2.2.1 Initialization

The server needs a directory to store persistant data. In the first extension of the NewServer function, I'll check for the existence of a given directory and execute initialization code if necessary. 

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

func NewServer(serverDir string) Server {
    exists, err := utils.PathExists(serverDir)

    if !exists {
        initializeServer()
    }
    ...
}

// File: main.go

func main() {
    cxt := NewServer("./srv")
}

{% endhighlight %}

The utils.PathExists comes from a local package that will hold general helper functions. PathExists wraps a couple other functions from Go's os package:[^fn1] os.Stat[^fn5] and os.IsNotExists.[^fn6] os.Stat returns a FileInfo[^fn7] struct describing the named file, while os.IsNotExist checks if the error returned by os.Stat indicates that the file or directory does not exist.

{% highlight golang %}

// File: utils/file.go

func PathExists(path string) (bool, error) {
    _, err := os.Stat(path)
    if err == nil { return true, nil }
    if os.IsNotExist(err) { return false, nil }
    return false, err
}

{% endhighlight %}

Before implementing initializeServer, I'll add a new struct to hold all of the server directories and file paths. It's called ServerDiskContext. The only directories I need right now are base and log. I'll use the Join function from Go's filepath library to generate subdirectories.[^fn8] The updated code looks like this:

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

type ServerDiskContext struct {
    BaseDir string
    LogDir string
}

func NewServer(serverDir string) Server {
    ...
    diskCxt := ServerDiskContext{
        BaseDir: serverDir, 
        LogDir: filepath.Join(serverDir, LOG_DIRECTORY),
    }

    if !exists {
        initializeServer(diskCxt)
    }
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now I'll implement initializeServer. For now the job of this function is simply to create the directories specified in the ServerDiskContext struct.[^fn1] [^fn9]

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

func initializeServer(diskContext ServerDiskContext) {
    err := os.Mkdir(diskContext.BaseDir, 0755)
    ...
    err = os.Mkdir(diskContext.LogDir, 0755)
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

Building and running the code so far produces a directory like this:

```bash
C:.
│   <server>.exe
│
└───srv
    └───log
```

### 2.2.2 Startup

Now I want a function where I can put code to load and generate resources. There isn't anything happening here yet, but I'm including it now so it can be extended later.

{% highlight golang %}

// File: server/server.go

type Server struct {
    DiskContext ServerDiskContext
}

func NewServer(serverDir string) *Server {
    ...
    server := startupServer(diskCxt)
    return server
}

func startupServer(diskContext ServerDiskContext) *Server {
    return &Server{
        DiskContext: diskContext,
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

## 2.3 Logging

I'd like a way to track the actions of the server without muddying up the terminal with print statements. There's a nice logging package available for Go that I'll use for now.[^fn2] It has various print functions built in and functionality to pipe the output to a specified file. This is all I need to get started. I'll add a server method to generate a new log file and then log the end of the NewServer function.

{% highlight golang %}

func NewServer(serverDir string) *Server {
    ...
    log.Println("Server startup completed!")
    return server
}

func startupServer(diskContext ServerDiskContext) *Server {
    server := Server{
        DiskContext: diskContext,
    }

    server.GenerateNewLogFile()
    return &server
}

{% endhighlight %}

For now the server will generate a new log file every time it starts up and log to the same file until the server shuts down. I'll probably have to revist this and come up with a different scheme as the complexity of logging increases. 

Now, to implement GenerateNewLogFile. I may have to revisit some implementations details in the future to make them more robust, right now though I'm just trying to keep things simple until the basic functionality is proven. So, to name log files, I'll convert a time stamp from Go's time package[^fn3] to a string and append a ".log" to the end of the path.

{% highlight golang %}

func (s *Server) GenerateNewLogFile() {
	newLogPath := filepath.Join(s.DiskContext.LogDir, 
                                    time.Now().Format("2006-01-02_15_04_05") + ".log")
}

{% endhighlight %}

Then I create the file and and set the output of the log package. Check out the links to the new functioins below for more info: os.OpenFile[^fn10], log.SetFlags[^fn11], and log.SetOutput[^fn12].

{% highlight golang %}

func (s *Server) GenerateNewLogFile() {
    ...
    logFile, err := os.OpenFile(newLogPath, 
                                os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREATE | os.O_APPEND, 
                                0666) 

    log.SetFlags(log.Lshortfile | log.LstdFlags)
    log.SetOutput(logFile)
}

{% endhighlight %}

After building and running, the server directory looks like this:

```bash
C:.
│   <server>.exe
│
└───srv
    └───log
            log_2022-01-11_18:58:19     
```

And the contents of the log file are:

```bash
2022/01/11 18:58:19 server.go:37: Server startup completed!
```

# . Command Line Interface

A command line interface is necessary for users to be able to be able to interact with the server. Also, for development/debugging it will be nice to have some hooks into the internals of the server at runtime.

The CLI simply reads input from the terminal, checks if the input matches an internal command, and then runs the function associated with that command. None of the commands are hard coded into the CLI itself. Instead the api will allow users to add new commands.

I'll make a new package called cli, and use Go's bufio[^fn4] package to read input from the terminal. From bufio I'm utilizing NewReader[^fn13] and ReadString[^fn14], as well as TrimSpace[^fn16] from the strings[^fn15] package to clean up user input:

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: cli/cli.go

type CLI struct {	
    Reader *bufio.Reader
}

func NewCLI() CLI {
    return CLI{
        Reader: bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin),
    }
}

func (cli *CLI) Run() {
	
    fmt.Println("|------------------------------------|")
    fmt.Println("|----- SERVER CLI Version 0.0.0 -----|")
    fmt.Println("|------------------------------------|")

    for {
        fmt.Print("server> ")

        cmd, err := cli.Reader.ReadString('\n')

        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error! -", err)
        }

        cmd = strings.TrimSpace(cmd)

        fmt.Println(cmd)
    }

}

// File: main.go

func main() {
    ...
    cmdli := cli.NewCLI()
    cmdli.Run()
    ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

The above code produces the following output:

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/cli.png" alt="drawing" height="200" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

A more creative header and name is a problem for future me.

Now I need a way to add commands and callbacks. To implement this I'll use a hash map where a key is a command and the value is a struct containing some data about that command, most importantly, a callback function to execute:

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: cli/cli.go

type CLI struct {	
    ...
    CommandMap map[string]CommandInfo
}

type CommandInfo struct {
    Name string 
    Info string
    Callback func()
}

func NewCLI() CLI {
    return CLI{
        Reader: bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin),
        CommandMap: make(map[string]CommandInfo),
    }
}

func (cli *CLI) RegisterCommand(cmdInfo CommandInfo) {
    defaultCommands := []string{ HELP_COMMAND }

    for _, defCmd := range defaultCommands {
        if defCmd == cmdInfo.Name {
            log.Printf("Can't register command '%v', it is a built-in command", cmdInfo.Name)
            return
        }
    }
    
    _, ok := cli.CommandMap[cmdInfo.Name]

    if ok {
        log.Println("Command already registered", cmdInfo.Name)
    } else {
        log.Println("Command registered:", cmdInfo.Name)
        cli.CommandMap[cmdInfo.Name] = cmdInfo
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

I'm going to implement some default commands, so when registering a new command, first I ensure the name doesn't conflict with any exisiting default commands and then do the same with user defined commands.

I'll also edit the CLI's Run function to handle commands received from input.

{% highlight golang %}

// FILE: cli/cli.go

func (cli *CLI) Run() {
    ...
    for {
        ...
        cli.handleCommand(cmd)
    }
}

func (cli *CLI) handleCommand(cmd string) {
    switch cmd {
        case HELP_COMMAND:
            if len(cli.CommandMap) == 0 {
                fmt.Println("No commands available")	
            } else {
                fmt.Println("Available Commands:")
                for key, cmdInfo := range cli.CommandMap {
                    fmt.Printf("\t- %s: %s\n", key, cmdInfo.Info)
                }
            }

        default:
            cmdInfo, ok := cli.CommandMap[cmd]
            if ok {
                cmdInfo.Callback()
            } else {
                fmt.Println("Unknown Command:", cmd)
            }
    }
}

# . User Registration

The last thing I want to touch on in this post is creating the first HTTP endpoint: User Registration.

To do this I'm first going to write some JavaScript to simulate the behavior of the frontend. 

{% highlight html %}

// FILE: frontend/index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Communication Application Backend Functionality</title>
	<script src="index.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

	<!-- User Registration -->
	<button onclick="onClickRegister()">Register</button>
	<label for="register-uname">Username:</label>
	<input type="text" id="register-uname" name="register-uname">

	<label for="register-password">Password:</label>
	<input type="text" id="register-password" name="register-password">

  </body>
</html> 

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

// FILE: frontend/index.js

const onClickRegister = async () => {
    var username = document.getElementById("register-uname").value
    var password = document.getElementById("register-password").value

    if (username != "" && password != "") 
    {
        const res = await registerUser(username, password)
        if (res.ok)
        {
            console.log("User Successfully Registered:", username, password)
        }
        else
        {
            const errorText = await res.text();
            console.log("Error:", res.status, errorText)
        }
    }
    else
    {
        console.log("Enter a username and password")
    }
}


const registerUser = async (username, password) => {
    const res = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/register", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Accept": "application/json", "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ "username": username, "password": password })
    })

    return res
}

{% endhighlight %}

<img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/comm/p1/registration.png" alt="drawing" height="150" style="margin: 0 auto"/>

To keep things nice and clean, I'm going to separate the processing of the endpoint and the handling of the client request. I've made a new file in the server package called endpoints.go and added this code:

{% highlight golang %}

type RegisterEndpointData struct {
    Username string `json:"username"`
    Password string `json:"password"`
}

func RegisterHandler(callback func(RegisterEndpointData) bool, 
                     w http.ResponseWriter, 
                     r *http.Request) {
    if r.URL.Path != "/register" {
        http.Error(w, "404 not found.", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }

    if r.Method != "POST" {
        http.Error(w, "Method is not supported.", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }

    var reg RegisterEndpointData

    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&reg)
    if err != nil {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
        log.Println("Error:", err)
    }

    ok := callback(reg)

    if !ok {
        http.Error(w, "Unable to register user", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    }
}


{% endhighlight %}

In main I add a register endpoint, call the RegisterHandle function with a server specific callback, and I also run the command line on its own thread so as not to hold up the main thread. Then update main like this:

{% highlight golang %}

func main() {
    cxt := server.NewServer("./srv")
    ...
    go cmdli.Run()

    http.HandleFunc("/register", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        server.RegisterHandler(cxt.RegisterUser, w, r)
    })

    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil))
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now to implement server RegisterUser method:

{% highlight golang %}

var registeredUsers  = map[string]string{
    "admin": "password",
}

func (sc *Server) RegisterUser(data RegisterEndpointData) bool {
    for key, _ := range registeredUsers {
        if key == data.Username {
            log.Println("User registration failed. User already exists:", key)
            return false
        }
    }

    registeredUsers[data.Username] = data.Password
    log.Println("User registration success:", data.Username)

    return true
}

{% endhighlight %}
